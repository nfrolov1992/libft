# libft

Libft is an individual project at 42 that requires us to re-create some standard C library functions including some additional ones that can be used later to build a library of useful functions for the rest of the program.

Libc Functions: Some of the standard C functions

Additional functions: Functions 42 deems will be useful for later projects

Bonus Functions: Functions 42 deems will be useful for linked list manipulation

Personal Functions: Functions I believe will be useful later.
